Node.js Basics, Introduction to Node.js

 Node Js is not a programming langauge,technology, framework,library
Node Js is a js runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

Story:
 JS Cant Create Backend becuase it does not have functiality to interact with file system, database, server etc
 Ryan Dahl created Node Js in 2009 to overcome this limitation of JS
 Node Js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine which makes it fast and efficient
Chromes V8 engine is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google for the Chrome browser. It compiles JavaScript code into machine code, allowing for faster execution and improved performance.
Chrome V8 engine is written in C++ and is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it ideal for use in web browsers and other applications that require high-performance JavaScript execution.

V8 Engine is wrapped inside Node Js to execute JS code on server side
We will write js code and Node Js will use V8 engine to execute that code on server side means Code written in JS will be converted to machine code by V8 engine and then executed on server side
We will write js code that will reveive wrapper layer and that wrapper layer will be executed by V8 engine on server side with the help of Cpp module of V8 engine and will create backend functionality aka Server Side functionality

NodeJs is a js runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a set of built-in modules and APIs that enable developers to build server-side applications using JavaScript.

Installing Node.js and npm

https://nodejs.org/en
Download the LTS version for better stability

npm - Node Package Manager
It comes bundled with Node.js installation
It is used to manage packages and dependencies for Node.js projects

To check if Node.js and npm are installed correctly, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:
node -v
npm -v
